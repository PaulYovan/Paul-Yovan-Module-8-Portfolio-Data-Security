# Paul-Yovan-Module-8-Portfolio-Data-Security


# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that helps choose financial plans for its consumers. The issue that the company wanted me to address was the security in their code and to make it more secure due to the vulnerabilities in their code.

# What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
What I did well when I found the client's software security vulnerabilities was suppressing any of the false positives that the vulnerability report had, as well as figuring out the easiest ways to get rid of the vulnerabilities that the program had. It is important to code securely in case someone else needs to update your code, or you are collaborating with someone when making code. Software security ensures that the customers don't get hacked, which will lead to them recommending the company overall which will help the company's well-being.

# Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The part that the assessment was helpful to me was when I wrote down the vulnerability codes that the company had in their program. This was useful to me because I could easily look back at my assessment and see which error codes I need to do and the ones that I have done already.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased the layers of security for the program by mostly updating the dependencies that were outdated due to them being the main reason why the program was vulnerable. I would utilize the maven dependency to figure out the vulnerabilities that a program has.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ensured that there were no error codes when running my code, and after I refactored my code, I ran the maven dependency to see if there were any new vulnerabilities.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show future employers my code and assessment document for this assignment.
